We are excited to announce the first FlexFlow bootcamp, 9:00-13:00 PDT December 11th 2020.
The bootcamp is designed for people interested in using FlexFlow to accelerate the distributed training performance of DNN models written in TensorFlow Keras or PyTorch.
This year's bootcamp covers a series of tutorials on how to use FlexFlow, followed by hands-on exercises and office hours.
